Developer: Hello guys!

Beta tester: Hello!

Freebooter: Hi.

Developer: I'm ready to get started guys!

Beta tester: Me too!

Developer: Actually, I've already patched the insecurities. First I fixed the SQL injection stuff and then I hashed the passwords. I've also added file uploads and I'm working on some new ideas I have.

Beta tester: Hashing?

Developer: Yes! Hashing is great. This way we don't store passwords as plaintext. I used SHA256 hashing. It works like this: 

Developer: *screenshot*

Beta tester: Salt? 

Developer: Yes, that's part of what's great with hashing: We add a salt, which means that even if we hash the same password twice, it'll look different in the database. 

Developer: The salt is just a random value. For instance, mine is *___*

Beta tester: Interesting! I want to test the new features, but I keep forgetting my password

Devleloper: Hang on, I knew this would happen, so I wrote it down. I'll send it to you in a private message. 

Devleloper: Remember, the new features are expirimental and I haven't had time to think too much about security :S. There's a reason only you can see them. 

Developer: Just like there's certain stuff only the admin should know. 

Freebooter: That's right, I was the admin the whole time, that was the plot twist. What a delightful dramaturgical curl!
