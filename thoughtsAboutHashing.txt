I've just implemented hashing, which led me to write down some of my thoughts on why hashing is sooooo great.
And to save those thoughts in the file function in this messaging app which is definitely secure. 
This hashing is great! This way, even if someone was to get access to the database (which is surely impossible, 
since the first thing I did was protect the note taking app against SQL injections) they would only see the hashed passwords. 
I'm so happy about this hashing, that I even hashed my own password twice. A hash of a hash! 

That way I won't even have to think of an original password either.
